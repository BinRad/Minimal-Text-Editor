README:
Made by Binyamin Radensky
final project for assembly.
due to time constraints and
other projects this project has the
/
limited functionality that follows:
1. it can load files from cmd line
2. you can overwrite text
3. You can save the file
that you have written on
/
CONTROLS:
[crtl]+[s] = SAVE
[ESC] = leave
/
INFO:
*the number next to the save is the number of bytes written to the file
*it definitely could use some tweaking
and a lot more work
*if there is a save error, then just try hitting save a few times until success
